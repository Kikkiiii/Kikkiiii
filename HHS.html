        <h3>What are Hammer Head Sharks?</h3>
	<p>Hammer head sharks form the family Sphyrnidae, they are named for their unusual form of their head. Their head is flattened and laterally extended resembling the shape of a hammer.</p>
<p>Their evolution may explain the shape of their head, spacing their eyes further away gives them a 360 view.</p>
<p> This gives them an above and under view at all times. Their head shape also helped them with balance and manoverty, preventing them from loosing balance.</p>
<p>This unique evolution of their head is also related to their sensory function, by having their head more spread out it allows for these sensory pores to receive information from more ground.</p>
