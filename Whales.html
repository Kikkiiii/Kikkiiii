    <h3>Impacts of humanity</h3>
    <p>Unfortunately the fishing gear used for mass fishing is endangering the marine life.</p>
    <p>This is seen in the Indian Ocean. Tuna is a large part of their economy therefor fishing is done in mass.</p>
    <p>The littering of this fishing gear has indicated more then 300,000 marine mammals in the cetaceans family have died, this is the largest cause of death in the Indian Ocean.</p>
    <p>The WWF and others are working to prevent this fishing method in these areas and call for more reporting of when the mammals become entangeled.</p>
